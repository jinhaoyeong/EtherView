EtherView: Personal Blockchain Wallet Dashboard for Crypto Transaction
Tracking

1. Introduction

1.1 Background and Motivation
Ethereum has established itself as one of the foremost blockchain platforms, offering a
robust environment for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and diverse
token ecosystems. Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has revolutionized the concept
of programmable money by enabling developers to create sophisticated financial
instruments and applications that operate without traditional intermediaries. The
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) serves as the runtime environment for smart contracts,
processing millions of transactions daily and maintaining a state-based ledger that tracks
all account balances and contract storage.

The rapid expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) has accelerated transaction volume
and user engagement, driving the demand for portfolio management tools that not only
present data but also enhance decision-making with contextual intelligence. As of 2024,
Ethereum handles over a million daily transactions, with hundreds of millions of active
wallet addresses (Etherscan, 2024). The DeFi ecosystem has grown from a niche
experiment to a multi-billion dollar industry, with protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and
Compound facilitating billions in trading volume and lending activities. This exponential
growth has introduced new complexities in portfolio management, as users now interact
with multiple protocols simultaneously, hold various yield-bearing tokens, and participate
in governance activities across different platforms.

Mainstream tracking platforms such as Etherscan, Zerion, and DeBank primarily serve as
data explorers, displaying token balances and transaction histories without offering the
analytical depth needed to flag high-risk tokens or spotlight critical market events. These
platforms excel at providing raw data but fall short in delivering actionable insights that
could help users make informed decisions about their cryptocurrency investments. The
limitations become particularly evident when considering the complexity of modern DeFi
interactions, where users may hold liquidity provider (LP) tokens, participate in yield
farming across multiple protocols, and maintain positions in various derivatives
instruments.

Meanwhile, the surge in DeFi-related fraud, including rug pulls and honeypots, has
resulted in losses exceeding $1.5 billion in recent years (Chainalysis, 2024). Large
blockchain actors, known as "whales," have significant influence on token prices; their
high-volume transactions often precede market fluctuations—yet few tools alert ordinary
users when such movements occur (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024; Richter,
2025). Beyond on-chain activities, market sentiment—especially driven by news
headlines and social media—can swiftly sway token dynamics in unpredictable ways.
Emerging research indicates that deep learning and natural language processing (NLP)
models, when combined with sentiment analysis, can improve cryptocurrency price
predictions compared to traditional methods (Gurgul et al., 2023). Advanced
transformer-based AI architectures like Synthesizer Transformers have been applied to
forecast Bitcoin volatility using whale transaction data, demonstrating the potential of
predictive analytics in this space (Herremans & Low, 2022).

1.2 Problem Statement
Despite their utility in displaying raw blockchain data, existing Ethereum wallet trackers
fail to offer interpretive insights or predictive analysis. Current platforms operate as
sophisticated calculators, aggregating token balances and displaying transaction histories
without providing the context necessary for informed decision-making. Users are
presented with numerical data but lack the analytical framework to understand the
implications of their holdings or the risks associated with their investments. The passive
nature of these tools becomes particularly problematic in the fast-moving cryptocurrency
market, where opportunities and threats can emerge within minutes.

Users are left with token balances and transaction logs, forced to manually assess risk
factors—such as detecting scam tokens or evaluating a whale's market influence. Without
AI-driven mechanisms, many users overlook hidden threats, fail to capture early warning
signs, or misunderstand the sentiment-driven market movements that often impact asset
value. The sophistication of modern cryptocurrency scams has evolved to exploit these
blind spots, with malicious actors creating tokens and contracts that appear legitimate on
the surface but contain hidden vulnerabilities or exit mechanisms.

This gap results in under-informed investment decisions, heightened vulnerability to
scams, and missed reactions to market shifts. The cryptocurrency market's 24/7 nature
means that significant events can occur at any time, making manual monitoring
impractical for most users. The absence of intelligent alerting systems means that users
miss critical opportunities to rebalance their portfolios or protect themselves from
adverse market movements. There is a pressing need for a unified platform that
transforms raw blockchain data into real-time, AI-enhanced intelligence—offering
anomaly alerts, behavioral profiling, and sentiment-guided insights in an accessible,
user-friendly interface.

1.3 Objectives
This project's overarching goal is to create EtherView, a frontend-based Ethereum
portfolio tracker enriched with AI-powered features. EtherView aims to bridge the gap
between raw blockchain data and actionable intelligence by implementing sophisticated
analytical capabilities that enhance user decision-making and security awareness.
The specific objectives of EtherView encompass four primary areas of functionality:
Visualize token holdings and wallet summaries by enabling users to input any Ethereum
wallet address to retrieve token holdings, transaction history, and live fiat valuation,
providing comprehensive portfolio visualization tools that give users clear understanding
of their cryptocurrency holdings across multiple dimensions. Alert for whale transactions
by monitoring whale wallet activity and generating timely alerts regarding potential
market impact (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024; Richter, 2025),
democratizing access to whale movement intelligence previously available only to
institutional investors. Detect scam tokens using contract heuristics by implementing
AI-driven detection of rug pull and honeypot risks through analyzing contract behavior
and heuristics, addressing the critical security gap in current portfolio trackers. Analyze
crypto news with AI sentiment by integrating live crypto news with AI-based sentiment
classifications—Bullish, Bearish, Neutral, or Alert (Gurgul et al., 2023), enhancing user
understanding of market dynamics. Finally, maintain user privacy via a frontend-only
architecture ensuring user privacy through no private key handling or user authentication
while providing comprehensive portfolio analysis capabilities.

1.4 Scope and Limitations
EtherView focuses exclusively on the Ethereum mainnet and ERC-20 tokens, allowing
for deep integration with Ethereum-specific features while maintaining development
focus and ensuring optimal performance. This deliberate limitation reflects the platform's
dominance in the DeFi ecosystem and the maturity of its analytical tools and APIs. The
Ethereum mainnet provides a rich environment for testing AI-driven analytics due to its
high transaction volume, diverse token ecosystem, and comprehensive historical data.

EtherView does not support cross-chain features or token interactions like swaps or
staking. Built as a frontend-centric solution, it relies on public APIs and heuristic AI logic
rather than deep backend infrastructure, prioritizing user privacy and security while
reducing development complexity. The frontend-only architecture eliminates the need for
private key management or user authentication, reflecting Web3 development principles
where user sovereignty and data ownership are paramount. The reliance on public APIs
ensures accessibility and security while providing real-time data access, though this
introduces potential limitations in data availability and update frequency.

The rug pull detection system uses patterns such as locked liquidity and blocked sell
functions to flag suspicious tokens; however, it may not detect novel fraud tactics. Whale
transaction detection is based on known large wallets and may not anticipate undisclosed
movements. The sentiment analysis component depends on external news sources and
classifiers that may misinterpret tone or context. These limitations are acknowledged,
with steps outlined in Chapter 6 for future improvements through iterative development
and continuous refinement based on user feedback and emerging threat patterns.
1.5 Significance of the Study
EtherView pioneers a new category of Ethereum portfolio tools by embedding AI for risk
detection, whale movement alerts, and sentiment-driven insights, significantly elevating
users' ability to understand and react to market dynamics. Individual investors gain access
to institutional-grade analytical capabilities previously unavailable to retail users,
democratizing sophisticated market intelligence. The platform's AI-driven approach to
risk assessment helps level the playing field between institutional investors and
individual users by providing automated analysis of token risks, whale movements, and
market sentiment.

By offering proactive, automated intelligence, EtherView enhances security and
investment clarity while lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical users. The
platform serves as an educational tool helping users understand cryptocurrency market
complexities while providing practical insights for investment decisions. The research
contribution extends beyond immediate portfolio tracking applications, providing insights
into AI and blockchain technology integration applicable to other domains.

Furthermore, its frontend-only design prioritizes user privacy and security, eliminating
authentication or private key management needs—critical for Web3 user adoption. The
framework and techniques established provide a blueprint for future multi-chain or
cross-asset applications in blockchain intelligence. The project demonstrates how AI can
enhance blockchain transparency without compromising user privacy, providing a model
for future applications requiring sophisticated analytics while maintaining decentralized
principles.

2.0 Literature Review

2.1 Introduction

2.1.1 Role of Literature Review in System Design ​

The rapidly evolving fields of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) have seen
significant integration in recent years, particularly in financial technology applications
(Sharma et al., 2023). A comprehensive literature review serves as the foundation for
understanding the current state of research and identifying opportunities for innovation in
blockchain-based portfolio management tools. The review process informs system design
decisions by highlighting successful approaches, identifying common pitfalls, and
revealing gaps in existing solutions (Bhumichai et al., 2024). By synthesizing academic
and industry insights, this review ensures that EtherView’s design is grounded in both
theoretical rigor and practical applicability, addressing the unique challenges of Ethereum
portfolio management.
The interdisciplinary nature of blockchain and AI research requires careful consideration
of multiple domains, including computer science, finance, economics, and
human-computer interaction (Cuijpers et al., 2023). This multifaceted approach ensures
that the developed system addresses not only technical requirements but also user needs
and market dynamics. The literature review process guides the selection of appropriate
methodologies, technologies, and evaluation metrics for the EtherView project, ensuring
alignment with current best practices and emerging trends (Ressi et al., 2024).

2.1.2 Source Selection and Review Scope
Ethereum, being a prominent blockchain platform, has attracted a wide range of
developers, investors, and analysts who rely on wallet tracking, fraud detection, and
market behavior prediction (Etherscan, 2024). The source selection process prioritizes
peer-reviewed academic publications, industry reports from reputable organizations, and
technical documentation from established blockchain projects. This multi-source
approach ensures comprehensive coverage of both theoretical foundations and practical
implementations (Aloun et al., 2024). To maintain relevance, sources from 2023 to 2025
are emphasized, capturing the latest advancements in AI-blockchain integration and
cryptocurrency analytics.

To address the emerging challenges in user security, asset transparency, and
decision-making, a growing body of research has explored the synergies between AI
models and decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs) (Sharma et al., 2023). The review
scope encompasses recent developments in machine learning applications to blockchain
analysis, with particular focus on fraud detection, market behavior prediction, and
sentiment analysis in cryptocurrency contexts (Witt et al., 2024). This chapter reviews
scholarly and industry literature on four central themes relevant to the development of
EtherView: the convergence of AI and blockchain, whale activity and market behavior,
detection of rug pulls and malicious smart contracts, and sentiment analysis in the
cryptocurrency ecosystem. Each theme is examined through the lens of practical
application to portfolio management tools, ensuring relevance to the project’s objectives
(Wang, 2024).

2.2 AI and Blockchain Convergence
Figure 1: AI’s role in blockchain

The integration of AI into blockchain technologies has the potential to resolve several
limitations of blockchain, including scalability, smart contract vulnerabilities, and
inefficient risk monitoring (Bhumichai et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024). Existing
approaches leverage AI for anomaly detection, fraud prevention, and smart contract
validation, enabling systems to shift from reactive to proactive security mechanisms
(Duan et al., 2023; Elliptic et al., 2024).

Explainable AI (XAI) for Blockchain Security.​
Recent advancements in explainable AI (XAI) emphasize the need for interpretability in
blockchain-based analytics. Hasan, Rahman, Janicke, and Sarker (2024) proposed an
anomaly detection framework that not only identifies suspicious transactions but also
explains the rationale behind its predictions using techniques such as SHAP and LIME.
Similarly, Ambolis (2024) highlights how integrating XAI with blockchain audit trails
builds user trust in AI-based decision-making by providing clear, verifiable justifications
for alerts. This capability is crucial for tools like EtherView, where transparent
explanations for whale movement alerts or scam token warnings can improve user
confidence.

Privacy-Preserving AI in Blockchain Analytics.​
AI-driven blockchain systems also face challenges related to privacy. Federated learning
and secure multiparty computation have been suggested as viable solutions for applying
machine learning models to sensitive transaction data without exposing user information
(Hasan et al., 2024). This aligns directly with EtherView’s frontend-only design, which
processes data locally to ensure both security and privacy.

Decentralized AI Agents and Co-Evolution.​
Beyond security, blockchain infrastructure can support autonomous AI agents that
execute decentralized decision-making. These agents can use immutable blockchain data
to perform risk scoring or execute automated alerts in DeFi environments (Aloun et al.,
2024). Ambolis (2024) and Nguyen et al. (2024) further argue that AI-blockchain
convergence is evolving into a co-dependent ecosystem, where blockchain ensures trust
in AI outputs, and AI addresses blockchain’s complexity. This synergy supports
EtherView’s vision of AI-enhanced portfolio tracking.
2.2.1 AI for Blockchain Security and Validation
The integration of AI into blockchain technologies has the potential to resolve some of
blockchain’s core limitations, such as scalability, energy inefficiency, and smart contract
vulnerabilities (Bhumichai et al., 2024). AI-driven security mechanisms represent a
paradigm shift from reactive to proactive security approaches, enabling systems to
identify and mitigate threats before they cause significant damage (Nguyen et al., 2024).
Machine learning algorithms can analyze transaction patterns, smart contract behavior,
and network activity to detect anomalies that may indicate security breaches or malicious
activity (Duan et al., 2023). For instance, anomaly detection models can identify unusual
transaction flows, such as sudden spikes in token transfers, which may signal potential
exploits or market manipulations (Elliptic et al., 2024).

Figure 1: Illustration of artificial intelligence integrated into blockchain operations. AI
components assist in smart contract automation, transaction classification, and consensus
validation. This diagram exemplifies how predictive learning and decision-making processes
can be embedded within decentralized architectures, enabling proactive risk detection and
secure transaction handling—key capabilities underpinning EtherView’s AI-driven design
(Bakhouch & Sahraoui, 2025).
Recent advancements have introduced generative AI models to enhance blockchain
security by simulating attack scenarios and identifying vulnerabilities in real-time. These
models can generate synthetic transaction data to stress-test blockchain systems, helping
developers anticipate edge cases that traditional testing might miss. This proactive
approach is critical for high-throughput networks like Ethereum, where transaction
volumes exceed one million daily, increasing the attack surface for malicious actors
(Etherscan, 2024).

AI contributes to operational efficiency by automating data analysis on-chain and
enabling anomaly detection in near real-time (Nguyen et al., 2024). The implementation
of AI-driven validation systems can significantly reduce the computational overhead
associated with traditional consensus mechanisms while maintaining security guarantees.
This efficiency improvement is particularly relevant for high-throughput blockchain
applications where traditional validation methods may become bottlenecks (Ressi et al.,
2024).

2.2.2 Smart Contract Auditing and Optimization
Studies have explored AI’s role in optimizing smart contract security and developed deep
learning-based models for detecting vulnerabilities like reentrancy and timestamp
manipulation (Chen et al., 2024). The application of natural language processing
techniques to smart contract code analysis has shown promising results in identifying
potential security issues that traditional static analysis tools might miss (Qian et al.,
2023). For example, NLP models trained on Solidity code can detect semantic
inconsistencies in contract logic, such as hidden transfer restrictions, enhancing the
robustness of automated audits.

Machine learning models trained on large datasets of smart contract vulnerabilities can
achieve high accuracy in identifying potential security risks across different contract
types and programming patterns (De Baets et al., 2024). These models can analyze both
the source code and the compiled bytecode, providing comprehensive security
assessment capabilities that complement traditional auditing approaches (Iuliano & Di
Nucci, 2025). Recent research has also explored reinforcement learning for optimizing
smart contract gas usage, reducing transaction costs for users while maintaining security.
Such optimizations are critical for Ethereum applications, where gas fees can
significantly impact user experience.

The integration of AI into smart contract development workflows enables continuous
security monitoring and automated vulnerability detection throughout the development
lifecycle (Nguyen et al., 2024). This proactive approach to smart contract security is
essential for maintaining user trust and preventing the significant financial losses
associated with smart contract exploits, which have exceeded $1.5 billion in recent years
(Chainalysis, 2024).
2.2.3 Blockchain Infrastructure for AI Agents
The synergy of AI and blockchain provides new frameworks for decentralized
decision-making, particularly in industries requiring auditability and real-time automation
(Aloun et al., 2024). AI-based agents can autonomously make resource allocation
decisions in a decentralized environment while ensuring transparency via blockchain
(Akther et al., 2025). This combination enables the creation of sophisticated autonomous
systems that can operate without central control while maintaining accountability and
traceability (Witt et al., 2024).

Blockchain infrastructure can support AI agents by providing immutable audit trails,
decentralized governance mechanisms, and secure data sharing protocols (Akther et al.,
2025). The integration of AI agents with blockchain networks enables the development of
self-governing systems that can adapt to changing conditions while maintaining
transparency and trust (Nguyen et al., 2024).

The emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represents a practical
application of AI-blockchain integration, where AI agents can participate in governance
decisions based on predefined criteria and real-time data analysis (Aloun et al., 2024).
This approach democratizes access to sophisticated decision-making capabilities while
maintaining the transparency and accountability benefits of blockchain technology
(Akther et al., 2025).

2.2.4 Co-evolution in AIoT, Finance, and Supply Chains
A comprehensive review categorizes AI-blockchain convergence into three areas: AI for
blockchain (smart contract auditing, fraud detection), Blockchain for AI (data
provenance, privacy-preserving computation), and Co-evolutionary applications
(distributed AI agents in blockchain-based IoT networks) (Ressi et al., 2024). This
categorization provides a framework for understanding the different approaches to
combining these technologies and their respective benefits and challenges (Witt et al.,
2024).

Bibliometric studies confirm the upward trajectory of research in this area (Sharma et al.,
2023). Scholarly analyses identify a significant number of publications focused on AI in
blockchain and IoT systems, indicating a growing trend (Sharma et al., 2023). The
increasing volume of research publications demonstrates the scientific community's
recognition of the potential for AI-blockchain integration across multiple domains (Wang,
2024).

As the volume of blockchain data grows, machine learning will become indispensable in
managing and interpreting that information (Nguyen et al., 2024). The exponential
growth in blockchain transaction volumes and the increasing complexity of smart
contract interactions create challenges that can only be addressed through sophisticated
AI-driven analysis tools (Elliptic et al., 2024).

Further research demonstrates how integrating AI datasets into blockchain enhances
transparency, ensuring data provenance and facilitating trustworthy decision-making
(Ghosh & Basu, 2023). AI applications also extend to fraud detection in decentralized
environments (Elliptic et al., 2024). Ensemble learning techniques have been used to
build models that identify unusual transaction patterns across public chains (Liu et al.,
2023). These studies highlight the potential of AI to significantly increase blockchain
efficiency and intelligence, and they directly inspire the architectural decisions in
EtherView (Witt et al., 2024).

​
This table synthesizes the AI-blockchain convergence approaches discussed in Section
2.2. AI for blockchain security provides foundational protection through proactive threat
detection but faces computational challenges. Smart contract auditing offers specialized
vulnerability detection with high accuracy for known patterns but may struggle with
novel attacks. Decentralized AI agents represent advanced autonomous systems that
maintain transparency through blockchain integration, though implementation complexity
remains high. Co-evolutionary applications demonstrate the mature integration of both
technologies, enabling mutual enhancement across multiple domains while requiring
specialized technical expertise (Ressi et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024).

2.3 Whale Activity and Market Dynamics
Whales—wallets holding disproportionately large cryptocurrency amounts—exert
significant influence over market trends (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024).
Their high-volume transactions often serve as leading indicators of market volatility, with
research showing that whale inflows to exchanges can precede downward price
movements (CryptoQuant, 2023; Richter, 2025).

Behavioral Clustering of Whale Addresses.​
Recent research has demonstrated that whales frequently distribute assets across multiple
wallets to obscure their activity. Chen et al. (2024) introduced clustering techniques that
identify behavioral similarities among addresses, thereby uncovering hidden whale
networks. Integrating such clustering into EtherView could improve its ability to track
market-moving wallets and provide more reliable alerts.

Whale Data Combined with Market Sentiment.​
Azamjon, Sattarov, and Na (2024) demonstrated that combining whale transaction data
with sentiment derived from social signals (e.g., Whale-Alert tweets) significantly
improves Bitcoin volatility forecasting. This suggests that EtherView’s dual
approach—tracking whale movements alongside AI-powered sentiment analysis—can
offer more actionable insights than relying on on-chain data alone.

Heuristic vs. Machine Learning Alerts.​
Traditional heuristic-based whale alerts focus on transaction size thresholds or exchange
inflow patterns (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024). However, machine
learning models have been shown to reduce false positives by considering temporal
factors and historical whale behavior (Azamjon et al., 2024). By merging these
approaches, EtherView can deliver more accurate, context-aware whale alerts.
2.3.1 Definition and Influence of Whale Wallets
Whales, or entities that hold disproportionately large amounts of cryptocurrency,
significantly influence market prices and user behavior (Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia, 2024). The cryptocurrency market's relatively small market capitalization
compared to traditional financial markets means that large holders can have
disproportionate impact on price movements, creating unique dynamics that require
specialized analytical approaches (Wang, 2024).
Analyses of whale wallet transactions reveal that sudden accumulation or liquidation by
these actors causes measurable price deviations, often leading to panic selling or
speculative buying among smaller investors (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,
2024). The psychological impact of whale movements extends beyond their immediate
market effect, influencing sentiment and trading behavior across the broader
cryptocurrency community (Richter, 2025).​
​

Figure 1: Average daily buy/sell activity across Ethereum e-wallets of different sizes
(2018–2023). Larger wallets (> $1M) display more volatile but impactful trading
behavior compared to smaller wallets, supporting the notion of whale-led market
dynamics.

The identification and tracking of whale wallets present unique challenges due to the
pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses (Elliptic et al., 2024). Advanced clustering
algorithms and transaction pattern analysis are required to group related addresses and
identify the true extent of whale holdings (Nguyen et al., 2024). This complexity
necessitates sophisticated analytical approaches that can account for the various strategies
whales employ to obscure their activities (Wang, 2024).

2.3.2 Exchange Inflow/Outflow Patterns
Industry analyses show that spikes in net inflow from whale wallets to centralized
exchanges are consistently correlated with market downturns (CryptoQuant, 2023). The
transfer of large amounts of cryptocurrency from private wallets to exchanges is often
interpreted as a precursor to selling activity, creating selling pressure that can trigger
broader market corrections (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024).

Trading signals reacting to whale transfers within short time windows have demonstrated
significant outperformance over traditional momentum strategies (Ramesh & Zhang,
2024). The predictive power of whale movement analysis stems from the information
asymmetry between large holders and retail investors, where whale actions often reflect
superior market knowledge or strategic positioning (Richter, 2025).

The development of real-time whale monitoring systems has become a crucial component
of modern cryptocurrency trading strategies (Wang, 2024). These systems must balance
the need for timely alerts with the accuracy of whale identification, as false positives can
lead to unnecessary market volatility and poor investment decisions (Elliptic et al., 2024).

Figure 2: Daily average buy/sell activity of Ethereum wallets segmented by asset size
(2018–2023). The chart illustrates how wallets exceeding $1 million in value exhibit
pronounced volatility and activity spikes—patterns often correlated with exchange
inflows and market selloffs. These findings reinforce the rationale for real-time whale
monitoring systems and justify EtherView’s integration of transaction-triggered alert
mechanisms (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024).
2.3.3 Neural Forecasting Models with Whale Data
Some research has developed Transformer-based models that forecast Bitcoin volatility
using whale transaction data combined with market indicators (Herremans & Low, 2022).
These advanced neural network architectures can capture complex temporal
dependencies in whale behavior and market responses, providing more accurate volatility
predictions than traditional econometric models (Nguyen et al., 2024).
Some researchers have developed whale impact scoring systems using random forest
classification to determine the probability of price swings within a short period
post-transaction (Zhou et al., 2023). Neural forecasting frameworks that include
whale-related address clustering have also been implemented to reduce noise in volatility
prediction (Ghosh & Basu, 2023).
The application of deep learning techniques to whale behavior analysis has revealed
complex patterns that were previously undetectable using traditional statistical methods
(Wang, 2024). These models can identify subtle behavioral changes that may indicate
shifts in market sentiment or upcoming significant events (Nguyen et al., 2024).

2.3.4 Heuristic vs Machine Learning Alerts
Frameworks for real-time whale alert systems based on wallet reputation and transaction
velocity have also been proposed (Richter, 2025). These systems emphasize the
importance of distinguishing between active whales who regularly interact with
exchanges and silent whales who move funds during market downturns (Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia, 2024). The development of sophisticated classification systems
enables more nuanced understanding of whale behavior and its potential market impact
(Wang, 2024).

EtherView's whale detection model integrates these heuristics with Ethereum-specific
contract call tracing to provide early warning signals (Nguyen et al., 2024). The
combination of heuristic rules with machine learning algorithms creates a robust
detection system that can adapt to evolving whale strategies while maintaining high
accuracy in identifying significant market-moving events (Elliptic et al., 2024).

These findings collectively validate EtherView's design decision to monitor whale wallet
activity and associate specific patterns with risk categories (Witt et al., 2024). By
integrating AI into this tracking, EtherView supports risk mitigation and informed user
decision-making. The systematic approach to whale monitoring provides users with
actionable intelligence that can inform their trading and investment strategies (Wang,
2024).

2.4 Rug Pull and Scam Detection in Smart Contracts
DeFi’s permissionless nature has enabled innovative financial mechanisms but also given
rise to significant fraud risks. Rug pulls—where developers drain liquidity after attracting
investors—have caused losses exceeding billions of dollars in recent years (Chainalysis,
2024).

AI-Powered Fraud Detection.​
Sun, Ma, Nie, and Liu (2024) conducted a systematic analysis of rug pull mechanisms
and concluded that hybrid detection systems combining static contract analysis and
behavioral transaction monitoring are the most effective. Similarly, Lin et al. (2024)
introduced CRPWarner, a tool that detects high-risk DeFi contracts by evaluating
liquidity locking, developer wallet concentration, and suspicious opcodes. EtherView’s
scam detection engine can be enhanced by applying these findings to provide real-time,
actionable warnings.
Transaction-Level Rug Pull Detection.​
Recent research in Blockchain: Research and Applications proposed using transaction
flow analysis to detect emerging rug pulls on decentralized exchanges before liquidity is
drained (Rug Pull Detection on Decentralized Exchange, 2025). This dynamic approach
complements static analysis by capturing live risk signals, enabling EtherView to warn
users earlier.

Crowdsourced Fraud Intelligence.​
Integrating AI-driven detection with community reporting improves fraud identification
speed and accuracy. Wu and Zhang (2024) highlighted that platforms leveraging
community-based flagging (e.g., TokenSniffer) alongside machine learning models
significantly reduced false negatives. This supports EtherView’s future potential for
incorporating user-driven fraud intelligence.

2.4.1 Overview of DeFi Fraud Mechanisms
The proliferation of DeFi protocols and permissionless token creation has given rise to
sophisticated scams, including rug pulls and honeypots (Chainalysis, 2024). The
decentralized nature of blockchain technology, while enabling innovation and financial
inclusion, has also created new opportunities for fraudulent activities that exploit the
technical complexity and regulatory gaps in the cryptocurrency ecosystem (MDPI, 2025).

Contract scanners that perform opcode-level analysis can flag contracts with a high
probability of being malicious (Lin et al., 2024). These tools use static analysis and a
feature extraction mechanism that includes variable visibility, dev wallet percentage, and
liquidity status (Lin et al., 2024). The automated analysis of smart contract bytecode
enables the detection of suspicious patterns that may indicate fraudulent intent, such as
hidden functions or unusual token distribution mechanisms (Elliptic et al., 2024).

The evolution of DeFi fraud has led to increasingly sophisticated attack vectors that
exploit the composability of smart contracts and the complexity of multi-protocol
interactions (De Baets et al., 2024). Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for
developing effective detection systems that can identify potential threats before they
cause significant financial damage (Nguyen et al., 2024).

2.4.2 Rule-Based and Static Analysis Tools
Other studies have examined contract metadata and backdoor functions such as
setBalance or transferOwner, which are often indicators of rug-pull risk (MDPI, 2025).
Balance-tracking models have been designed to flag contracts where large portions of
supply are concentrated in developer wallets (MDPI, 2025). The identification of these
risk indicators requires comprehensive analysis of contract functionality and token
distribution patterns (Iuliano & Di Nucci, 2025).
Additional tools use rule-based inference engines coupled with natural language contract
documentation analysis to detect scams masquerading as utility tokens (Ramesh &
Zhang, 2024). The combination of code analysis and documentation review provides a
more comprehensive assessment of project legitimacy than either approach alone (Chen
et al., 2024).

Static analysis tools have proven effective in identifying common vulnerability patterns
in smart contracts, but they may struggle with novel attack vectors or contracts that use
obfuscation techniques (De Baets et al., 2024). The development of adaptive detection
systems that can learn from new attack patterns is essential for maintaining effectiveness
against evolving threats (Nguyen et al., 2024).

2.4.3 ML Models for Smart Contract Risk Detection
The detection of malicious or fraudulent smart contracts is a critical area in blockchain
security, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this
process. One promising approach involves the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
analyze both the abstract syntax tree (AST) of smart contract source code and their
transaction histories. These models are capable of learning from both structural and
behavioral data, enabling high accuracy in distinguishing scam tokens from legitimate
ones (Xu et al., 2025). The dual-layer architecture of such models—which integrates
contract logic and on-chain activity—has proven especially effective in capturing subtle
indicators of risk (Qian et al., 2023).

In addition to GNNs, supervised learning models such as Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to labeled
datasets containing thousands of scam and non-scam contracts. These datasets typically
include features such as opcode frequency, function call patterns, and transaction
behavior. The availability of large-scale, high-quality labeled data has enabled the
development of models that generalize well across various smart contract platforms and
attack types (De Baets et al., 2024; Elliptic et al., 2024).

Ensemble methods, which combine multiple ML models into a unified prediction
framework, have also shown significant promise in enhancing the robustness and
reliability of smart contract risk detection systems. These approaches allow for leveraging
the strengths of different algorithms—such as decision trees, neural networks, and
probabilistic classifiers—while mitigating their individual weaknesses (Liu et al., 2023).
Recent developments also include incremental learning strategies, where ML models are
updated progressively as new scam patterns emerge. This dynamic learning capability
reduces false negatives and ensures the model adapts to evolving threats (Nguyen et al.,
2024).
Figure 3: Performance trends in incremental learning for blockchain-based ML model
updates.​
This figure presents the evolution of key metrics—training accuracy, test accuracy,
precision, recall, F-beta score, and false negative rate—across eight model increments.
The consistent rise in F-beta score and steady decline in FNR indicate improved fraud
detection over time without overfitting. This demonstrates the potential of iterative ML
techniques, such as ensemble learning and incremental retraining, to enhance smart
contract risk detection models in blockchain environments (Pranto et al., 2022).

2.4.4 Limitations and Challenges in Real-Time Risk Warnings
These research efforts demonstrate that smart contract analysis using AI and machine
learning techniques can preemptively protect users from fraud (Elliptic et al., 2024). By
using a hybrid approach that combines these features, EtherView's AI engine aims to
deliver accurate, real-time risk assessments directly in the user interface (Nguyen et al.,
2024). However, the deployment of these systems in production environments presents
unique challenges related to performance, scalability, and user experience (Witt et al.,
2024).

The real-time nature of blockchain transactions requires detection systems that can operate
with minimal latency while maintaining high accuracy (Nguyen et al., 2024). The trade-off
between speed and accuracy represents a fundamental challenge in the design of practical
fraud detection systems (Elliptic et al., 2024).
                                                                                         ​
Figure 3: Trends in crypto-related fraud incidents from 2011 to 2023. The chart shows
both the number of reported incidents (right axis) and the total financial impact in
millions (left axis). The sharp rise in 2021 and 2022 underscores the increasing scale and
sophistication of blockchain-based fraud, highlighting the need for real-time, AI-driven
detection systems such as those integrated into EtherView (Luo et al., 2023).

The continuous evolution of fraud techniques necessitates adaptive detection systems that
can learn from new attack patterns and update their models accordingly (De Baets et al.,
2024). The development of such systems requires ongoing research and collaboration
between the academic community and industry practitioners (Witt et al., 2024).

2.5 Sentiment Analysis and News Impact
Market sentiment—driven by news headlines, social media, and regulatory
developments—plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency price volatility (Gurgul et al.,
2023).

Event-Driven Sentiment Modeling.​
Yousaf, Tariq, and Jabbar (2024) reviewed sentiment-based forecasting models and found
that event-specific sentiment (e.g., exchange hacks or SEC lawsuits) strongly correlates
with short-term price swings. Similarly, Ferranti et al. (2024) demonstrated that
combining price data with sentiment derived from transformer-based NLP models
significantly improves cryptocurrency prediction accuracy. For EtherView, this justifies
the integration of CryptoPanic API sentiment feeds to detect high-risk news events and
generate real-time alerts.

Cross-Platform Sentiment Aggregation.​
Research indicates that aggregating sentiment from multiple sources—including crypto
forums, Twitter, and specialized news sites—yields more robust predictive performance
than single-source models (Ferranti et al., 2024). By sourcing news from CryptoPanic
and applying AI-based sentiment classification, EtherView ensures that users receive
context-rich, bias-mitigated insights.

Figure 2: Monthly distribution of Bitcoin-related tweets collected between February 5,
2021, and March 5, 2023. ​
This figure visualizes the volume of Bitcoin-related tweets over time, highlighting
fluctuations in public interest and engagement across different months and years. By
identifying spikes and declines in tweet activity, the chart illustrates how public sentiment
evolves in relation to market trends. This temporal view supports sentiment-based
forecasting models in cryptocurrency, which often rely on social media trends as input
features for deep learning architectures (Seabe, Moutsinga, & Pindza, 2025).
Market Psychology and Sentiment Decay.​
Sentiment effects in crypto are often short-lived. Studies show that the predictive power
of crypto news sentiment decays within hours rather than days (Yousaf et al., 2024). This
supports EtherView’s real-time alerting mechanism, ensuring users act before
sentiment-driven price movements diminish.

2.5.1 NLP in Financial Forecasting
Market sentiment—driven by news headlines, social media discussions, and regulatory
announcements—has a profound effect on cryptocurrency volatility (Gurgul et al., 2023).
The application of natural language processing techniques to financial forecasting has
shown significant promise in capturing market sentiment and predicting price movements
(Frohmann et al., 2023). The integration of sentiment analysis with traditional financial
indicators provides a more comprehensive view of market dynamics (Bhowmik, 2024).
Transformer-based models trained on multi-source text data, including Reddit threads,
crypto news headlines, and social platform activity, have achieved high predictive
accuracy for short-term price movements (Gaur et al., 2025). These advanced NLP
models can process vast amounts of unstructured text data and extract meaningful
sentiment indicators that correlate with market movements (Nguyen et al., 2024).

The development of domain-specific sentiment analysis models for cryptocurrency
markets has addressed the unique challenges posed by the technical vocabulary and
community-specific language used in crypto discussions (Seabe et al., 2025). These
specialized models achieve higher accuracy than general-purpose sentiment analysis tools
when applied to cryptocurrency-related content (Wang, 2024).

2.5.2 Transformer and LSTM-based Crypto Models
Studies exploring the relationship between sentiment analysis and whale transaction
timing have shown that sentiment-neutral whale alerts have less market impact compared
to those accompanied by strongly negative news coverage (Seabe et al., 2025). The
interaction between sentiment and whale activity creates complex market dynamics that
require sophisticated analytical approaches to understand and predict (Nguyen et al.,
2024).

Sentiment indicators applied to high-frequency trading (HFT) models have resulted in
better risk-adjusted returns than traditional technical indicators (Bhowmik, 2024).
Sentiment classification is especially valuable in crypto markets, where fundamentals are
less established compared to traditional equities (Yin et al., 2020).

The development of multi-modal models that combine sentiment analysis with price
action and on-chain metrics has shown promise in creating more robust prediction
systems (Gaur et al., 2025). These integrated approaches can capture the complex
relationships between different market factors and provide more accurate forecasts
(Wang, 2024).

2.5.3 Sentiment-Driven Trading and Market Behavior
Further research combines sentiment polarity detection with time-series price prediction
to assess the influence of news in speculative altcoin movements (Frohmann et al., 2023).
Analyses of sentiment amplification across social platforms reveal that negative
sentiment tends to travel faster and more broadly than positive sentiment—an effect also
seen in token price drops (Ghosh & Basu, 2023).

The viral nature of information spread in cryptocurrency communities creates unique
challenges for sentiment analysis systems (Nguyen et al., 2024). The rapid amplification
of both positive and negative sentiment through social media platforms can create
feedback loops that significantly impact market behavior (Wang, 2024).
The development of real-time sentiment monitoring systems that can track sentiment
across multiple platforms and sources provides traders and investors with valuable
insights into market psychology (Bhowmik, 2024). These systems must balance the need
for comprehensive coverage with the accuracy of sentiment classification (Gaur et al.,
2025).

2.5.4 Data Sources and Model Reliability in Crypto News
The reliability of sentiment analysis in cryptocurrency markets heavily depends on the
quality and diversity of data sources used for training and inference (Gurgul et al., 2023).
Research has identified several challenges in crypto news sentiment analysis, including
the rapid evolution of cryptocurrency terminology, the prevalence of market manipulation
through coordinated news campaigns, and the difficulty in distinguishing between
legitimate news and promotional content (Frohmann et al., 2023).

Studies have shown that aggregating sentiment data from multiple sources—including
mainstream financial news, specialized crypto publications, social media platforms, and
regulatory announcements—significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to
single-source approaches (Bhowmik, 2024). The temporal aspect of news sentiment is
particularly crucial in crypto markets, where information decay rates are much faster than
traditional financial markets (Gaur et al., 2025). Research indicates that crypto news
sentiment typically loses predictive power within 2-6 hours, compared to days or weeks
for traditional equity markets (Seabe et al., 2025).

The challenge of fake news and market manipulation through coordinated sentiment
campaigns has led researchers to develop verification mechanisms that cross-reference
multiple news sources and apply credibility scoring to different outlets (Gurgul et al.,
2023). Advanced NLP models now incorporate source reliability weights and temporal
decay functions to improve sentiment classification accuracy in real-time trading
scenarios (Nguyen et al., 2024).

The relevance of sentiment data is reinforced by findings that fear, uncertainty, and doubt
(FUD) events such as exchange hacks or lawsuits can lead to significant intraday drops in
token value (Chainalysis, 2024). Integrating sentiment classification into EtherView helps
mitigate such risks by issuing alerts during high-risk sentiment events (Wang, 2024).

This table summarizes the fraud detection and market analysis methods examined across
Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5. Static contract analysis provides reliable detection of known
fraud mechanisms but lacks adaptability to emerging threats. Behavioral pattern
recognition offers broader coverage but requires substantial data resources. Graph Neural
Networks represent cutting-edge detection capability with high accuracy but demand
significant computational resources. Machine learning models benefit from large-scale
training but face generalization challenges. Whale transaction monitoring has proven
market prediction value through historical correlations, while sentiment analysis provides
valuable short-term insights despite rapid information decay. The evolution toward
hybrid approaches reflects the complexity of modern cryptocurrency markets where no
single method addresses all security and analysis requirements (Sun et al., 2024; Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2024).
2.6 Summary
While existing tools provide individual solutions—portfolio tracking (Etherscan), fraud
detection (TokenSniffer), or whale monitoring (Whale Alert)—no single platform
integrates these functionalities with AI-driven analytics and privacy-focused design.

EtherView uniquely addresses this gap by:

    ●​ Incorporating XAI-backed fraud and whale monitoring models to improve
         interpretability (Hasan et al., 2024; Ambolis, 2024).

    ●​ Combining on-chain whale data with real-time sentiment analysis for more
         accurate market impact prediction (Azamjon et al., 2024; Yousaf et al., 2024).

    ●​ Utilizing transaction-level scam detection enhanced by behavioral and
         crowdsourced intelligence (Sun et al., 2024; Rug Pull Detection, 2025).

    ●​ Implementing a frontend-only architecture, maintaining security and user data
         sovereignty while delivering enterprise-grade blockchain intelligence (Nguyen et
         al., 2024).

This integration creates a unified AI-powered tool that addresses the fragmented
landscape of blockchain analytics, positioning EtherView as a comprehensive solution for
Ethereum investors seeking actionable, real-time insights.

2.6.1 Summary of Reviewed Themes
The literature reviewed in this chapter provides a strong foundation for the development
of EtherView across four key domains (Witt et al., 2024). First, the convergence of AI
and blockchain enables intelligent automation in smart contract validation, fraud
detection, and data analytics (Nguyen et al., 2024). This convergence is particularly
evident in the development of AI-powered consensus mechanisms, automated
vulnerability detection systems, and decentralized AI agents that can operate
autonomously within blockchain environments (Akther et al., 2025).

Second, research on whale activity confirms the viability of using high-volume
transaction patterns as leading indicators of market volatility (Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia, 2024). The studies demonstrate that whale behavior analysis, when
combined with machine learning techniques, can provide early warning signals for
market movements (Wang, 2024). The integration of neural forecasting models with
whale transaction data has shown promising results in predicting short-term price
volatility (Herremans & Low, 2022).
Third, the rise in smart contract-related fraud underscores the need for robust detection
mechanisms, which modern AI models can fulfill through syntax, behavior, and metadata
analysis (Elliptic et al., 2024). The evolution from rule-based detection systems to
sophisticated machine learning approaches has significantly improved the accuracy of
fraud detection while reducing false positive rates (De Baets et al., 2024).

Finally, the influence of news sentiment on crypto asset prices justifies the inclusion of
NLP-powered sentiment classification in decision-support tools (Bhowmik, 2024). The
integration of multi-source sentiment data with real-time market analysis has proven
effective in predicting market movements and identifying potential risk events (Gaur et
al., 2025).

2.6.2 Research Gap and Justification for EtherView
Despite the extensive research in individual domains, a significant gap exists in the
integration of these AI-powered features into a unified, user-friendly platform (Wang,
2024). Most existing tools focus on single aspects—either portfolio tracking, fraud
detection, whale monitoring, or sentiment analysis—without providing a comprehensive
solution that combines all these elements (Witt et al., 2024).

Current blockchain analytics platforms typically require technical expertise to interpret
data and lack the proactive intelligence needed for retail investors (Nguyen et al., 2024).
The separation of different analytical functions across multiple platforms creates
inefficiencies and increases the learning curve for users seeking comprehensive market
intelligence (Elliptic et al., 2024).

EtherView addresses this gap by integrating AI features into a user-facing, frontend-only
application, minimizing security risks while delivering real-time, actionable intelligence
to Ethereum users (Akther et al., 2025). The combination of these areas into a single
platform represents a novel approach that democratizes access to sophisticated
blockchain analytics previously available only to institutional investors and technically
skilled users (Wang, 2024).

The project's contribution lies not only in the technical integration of AI features but also
in the user experience design that makes complex blockchain analytics accessible to
mainstream crypto investors (Witt et al., 2024). By maintaining a frontend-only
architecture, EtherView ensures user privacy and security while providing
enterprise-grade analytical capabilities (Nguyen et al., 2024).
3.0 Methodology
3.1 System Architecture Overview

Figure 1: System Architecture: Component Design Diagram
System architecture diagram showing the multi-tier component design with Client Tier
(React App, Browser Cache), Application Server (Portfolio Engine, Data Processor, AI
Engine, Alert System), AI Services (Whale Tracker, Sentiment AI), External Data
Sources (Etherscan, CoinGecko, CryptoPanic), Data Persistence (Cache Store, Session
Store), and Security & Monitoring layers. The architecture demonstrates the separation of
concerns and scalable design principles that enable EtherView's comprehensive
blockchain analysis capabilities.​
3.1.1 Component Interaction Overview

                                                                                                             ​
                                    Figure 2: Data Flow Diagram
EtherView employs a modular, front-end-centric architecture designed to provide
comprehensive Ethereum portfolio analytics while maintaining user privacy and security
. The system architecture consists of five primary components that work in concert to
deliver AI-enhanced blockchain intelligence:
Data Acquisition Layer: This layer manages real-time data fetching from multiple
external APIs including Etherscan for transaction data, CoinGecko for price information,
and CryptoPanic for news sentiment. The layer implements rate limiting, error handling,
and data validation to ensure reliable information flow.
AI Intelligence Module: The artificial intelligence layer that provides three distinct
analytical capabilities: whale transaction monitoring, scam token detection using contract
heuristics, and sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency news. Each AI component operates
independently while sharing common data structures.
Processing Engine: The core analytical component that transforms raw blockchain data
into actionable insights. This engine handles portfolio calculations, transaction parsing,
and coordinate data processing for visualization components.
Alert System: A notification framework that provides users with timely warnings about
potential risks, whale movements, and market-relevant news based on AI analysis results.

User Interface Layer: A responsive React-based frontend that presents complex
blockchain analytics in an intuitive, user-friendly format. The interface adapts to different
screen sizes and provides real-time updates without requiring page refreshes.

The architecture follows a unidirectional data flow pattern where external APIs feed raw
data into the processing engine, which then distributes processed information to both the
AI module and user interface. This design ensures data consistency while allowing for
independent scaling of different system components.

3.1.2 Frontend-Only Design Principles
The frontend-only architecture represents a deliberate design choice prioritizing user
privacy, security, and accessibility. This approach eliminates the need for backend
infrastructure, reducing complexity and potential security vulnerabilities while ensuring
that users maintain complete control over their data.

Privacy by Design: The system operates entirely within the user's browser environment,
ensuring that no sensitive information is transmitted to external servers beyond public
API calls. User wallet addresses and transaction data remain on the client side, preventing
potential data breaches or unauthorized access.

Zero Trust Model: EtherView implements a zero-trust approach where no user
authentication or registration is required. Users can access full functionality without
creating accounts or providing personal information, aligning with Web3 principles of
decentralization and user sovereignty.

Stateless Operation: The application maintains no persistent state between sessions,
ensuring that user interactions cannot be tracked or monitored. Each session operates
independently, providing users with complete anonymity while using the platform.

3.1.3 Real-Time Data Fetching Approach
The real-time data fetching strategy balances the need for current information with API
rate limits and performance considerations. The system implements a multi-layered
caching mechanism that optimizes data retrieval while maintaining information freshness.

Adaptive Polling: The system employs adaptive polling intervals based on data volatility
and user activity (Seabe et al., 2023). High-frequency data such as token prices are
updated every 30 seconds during active use, while less volatile information like token
metadata is cached for longer periods.
Progressive Loading: To enhance user experience, the interface implements progressive
loading where essential portfolio information is displayed immediately while additional
features like AI analysis load asynchronously in the background (Ressi et al., 2024).

Error Resilience: The data fetching system includes comprehensive error handling with
automatic retry mechanisms, fallback data sources, and graceful degradation when APIs
are temporarily unavailable (Nguyen et al., 2024).

Rate Limit Management: Advanced rate limiting algorithms prevent API quota
exhaustion while maximizing data freshness (Etherscan, 2024). The system prioritizes
user-initiated requests over background updates and implements intelligent queuing for
non-critical data fetches.

3.2 Development Methodology

3.2.1 Agile Development Approach
EtherView development follows an iterative agile methodology adapted for academic
research projects (Marchesi et al., 2018; Díaz-Noci, 2020). This approach enables rapid
prototyping, continuous improvement, and flexibility in responding to emerging
requirements or technical challenges.

Sprint Planning: Development is organized into two-week sprints, each focusing on
specific functionality areas (Mohanty et al., 2020. Sprint planning sessions define clear
objectives, deliverables, and success criteria for each iteration.

Iterative Development: Each sprint produces a working prototype that can be tested and
evaluated. This approach allows for early identification of technical issues and user
experience problems before they become significant obstacles.

Continuous Integration: Development follows continuous integration practices where
code changes are regularly merged and tested (Marchesi et al., 2018). This approach
ensures code quality and reduces integration problems that could impact project
timelines.

Stakeholder Feedback: Regular feedback sessions with the project supervisor and
potential users inform development priorities and ensure that the final product meets user
needs and academic requirement.

3.2.2 Development Phase Planning
The development of EtherView follows an iterative agile methodology, structured into
four distinct phases to ensure systematic progress, flexibility, and alignment with the
demands of blockchain analytics projects, as outlined by Díaz-Noci (2020). Each phase
builds upon the previous one, incorporating continuous feedback and iterative refinement
to meet both technical and user expectations while maintaining academic rigor and
practical utility.

Phase 1: Foundation Development

The foundation phase establishes the core infrastructure for EtherView. This begins with
configuring a comprehensive development environment, including version control
systems, code quality standards, automated testing frameworks, and continuous
integration pipelines. Secure API key management and development tools are set up to
ensure optimal productivity. A scalable project architecture is implemented using React
best practices, featuring component-based organization, state management patterns, and
routing configuration to ensure maintainability and scalability, as described by Ressi et al.
(2024). The core user interface starts with a robust wallet address input system that
validates Ethereum addresses in real time using multiple validation methods via the
Etherscan API, including checksum validation, format verification, and network
compatibility checks. This system supports Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains and
QR code scanning for enhanced user convenience (Etherscan, 2024). Fundamental data
retrieval mechanisms are developed to interact with Etherscan and CoinGecko APIs,
utilizing reusable service modules that handle authentication, request formatting, error
handling, and response parsing. Rate limiting strategies prevent API quota exhaustion,
and advanced caching optimizes performance by reducing unnecessary API calls, with
fallback mechanisms ensuring reliability when primary data sources are unavailable
(Frohmann et al., 2023).

Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation

The second phase transforms the infrastructure into a functional portfolio management
tool. Comprehensive transaction parsing capabilities are developed to interpret and
categorize Ethereum transactions from the Etherscan API, identifying types such as token
transfers, DeFi interactions, and smart contract executions. The system calculates gas
costs, extracts relevant metadata, and includes advanced features like transaction tagging,
categorization for tax purposes, and profit/loss calculations (Etherscan, 2024).
Sophisticated algorithms handle token balance calculations for ERC-20, ERC-721, and
ERC-1155 standards, integrating real-time price data from CoinGecko and using Chart.js
to visualize portfolio composition, performance over time, and asset allocation.
Interactive charts offer drill-down capabilities and customizable time ranges for detailed
exploration (Seabe et al., 2023). A mobile-first, responsive user interface is created with

​
4.0 System Design and Implementation

4.1 UI/UX Design

4.1.1 Wireframes and Page Flow

The user interface design for EtherView follows a user-centered approach that prioritizes
clarity, efficiency, and accessibility in presenting complex blockchain analytics. The
wireframing process began with extensive analysis of existing portfolio tracking tools to
identify common pain points and opportunities for improvement (Wang, 2024). The
design philosophy emphasizes progressive disclosure, where users are presented with
essential information first, with detailed analytics available through intuitive navigation
patterns (Marchesi et al., 2018).

The primary page flow follows a logical sequence that mirrors typical user behavior
patterns in cryptocurrency portfolio management. Users begin with a simple wallet
address input interface that validates addresses in real-time, providing immediate
feedback about address validity and format compliance. Upon successful address
validation, users are directed to the main dashboard where portfolio overview information
is displayed prominently, including total portfolio value, asset allocation, and recent
transaction summaries (Ressi et al., 2024).

The navigation structure implements a hub-and-spoke model where the main dashboard
serves as the central hub connecting to specialized analysis modules. Each module
maintains consistent visual language and interaction patterns to reduce cognitive load and
improve user experience (Díaz-Noci, 2020). The whale tracking panel, scam detection
alerts, and sentiment analysis sections are accessible through clearly labeled navigation
elements that indicate the current analysis status and any pending alerts.

The wireframe design incorporates responsive breakpoints that ensure optimal user
experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Mobile-first design principles
guide the layout decisions, with touch-friendly interface elements and simplified
navigation patterns for smaller screens. The interface gracefully scales to larger displays
by expanding information density and enabling side-by-side comparison features that are
not available on mobile devices (Nguyen et al., 2024).

4.1.2 Responsive Design Principles

The responsive design implementation leverages modern CSS Grid and Flexbox
techniques to create fluid layouts that adapt seamlessly across different viewport sizes
and device orientations (Ressi et al., 2024). The breakpoint strategy follows a mobile-first
approach with carefully selected breakpoints at 768px, 1024px, and 1200px to
accommodate the most common device categories while ensuring optimal content
presentation (Ressi et al., 2024).

Typography scaling utilizes a modular scale approach where font sizes, line heights, and
spacing values are mathematically related to create visual harmony across all screen
sizes. The type system implements relative units (rem and em) combined with CSS
clamp() functions to provide smooth scaling between breakpoints without jarring jumps
in text size (W3C, 2023). The typographic hierarchy ensures that critical information
such as portfolio values and alert notifications remain clearly readable at all screen sizes
(W3C, 2023).

The color system implements sufficient contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards,
ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments while maintaining visual appeal
for all users (W3C, 2021). The implementation includes both light and dark mode
variants that automatically adapt to user system preferences through CSS media queries.
Color choices were validated using accessibility testing tools to ensure compliance with
international accessibility standards (W3C, 2021).

Interactive elements are designed with touch accessibility in mind, implementing
minimum target sizes of 44px for all clickable elements as recommended by mobile
accessibility guidelines. Hover states and focus indicators provide clear visual feedback
for both mouse and keyboard navigation, ensuring that the interface remains usable for
users relying on assistive technologies or alternative input methods (Díaz-Noci, 2020).

4.1.3 Color Coding and Alert Visuals

The visual design system employs a carefully crafted color palette that communicates
information hierarchy and urgency levels effectively while remaining aesthetically
pleasing and accessible. The primary color scheme utilizes semantic color associations
that align with user expectations in financial applications, where green typically indicates
positive changes or safe conditions, red suggests caution or negative changes, and blue
conveys neutral information or system status (Nguyen et al., 2024).

Alert visualization follows a three-tier system that clearly distinguishes between different
levels of urgency and required user action. High-priority alerts utilize prominent red
coloring with animated indicators to ensure immediate user attention, typically reserved
for critical security warnings such as scam token detection or significant whale
movements that might impact portfolio value. Medium-priority alerts employ amber
coloring with subtle animations to indicate situations requiring user attention without
creating alarm, such as unusual transaction patterns or market sentiment shifts.
Low-priority alerts use blue coloring with minimal visual emphasis for informational
updates that users may find interesting but don’t require immediate action (Marchesi et
al., 2018).

The color coding system extends to portfolio visualization where different asset types and
performance indicators are distinguished through consistent color assignments. Positive
portfolio performance is indicated through varying shades of green, with darker tones
representing larger gains and lighter tones showing modest improvements. Negative
performance utilizes red tones with similar intensity variations to provide immediate
visual feedback about portfolio status (Ressi et al., 2024).

Visual accessibility considerations include alternative indicators for color-blind users,
such as icons, patterns, and text labels that convey the same information as color coding.
The implementation includes customizable color themes that allow users with specific
visual needs to adjust the interface for optimal readability and comprehension (W3C,
2021).

relationships that demonstrate system functionality and user interaction patterns.
4.2.1 Wallet Input Interface
The wallet input interface serves as the primary entry point for users and implements
comprehensive validation mechanisms to ensure accurate address processing while
providing an intuitive user experience. The component utilizes ethers.js library functions
to perform real-time address validation that checks both format compliance and
checksum accuracy (Etherscan, 2024). The validation process occurs as users type,
providing immediate visual feedback through color changes and icon indicators that
confirm address validity without requiring form submission (Etherscan, 2024).
The interface supports multiple input methods to accommodate different user preferences
and technical capabilities. Traditional text input allows users to type or paste wallet
addresses directly, with automatic formatting that adds appropriate spacing and
capitalization for improved readability. QR code scanning functionality enables mobile
users to quickly input addresses by scanning QR codes from other applications or printed
materials, reducing manual entry errors and improving user convenience (Iuliano & Di
Nucci, 2025).

intelligence capabilities. The hybrid approach leverages the reliability and explainability
of rule-based systems while incorporating the pattern recognition capabilities of machine
learning models to identify complex relationships in blockchain data (Nguyen et al.,
2024).

The heuristic rule engine processes smart contract characteristics through predefined
criteria that identify common fraud patterns and security vulnerabilities. Rules are
structured hierarchically with weighted scoring systems that account for multiple risk
factors simultaneously. The engine evaluates contract ownership patterns, liquidity
mechanisms, trading restrictions, and historical behavior to generate risk scores that are
immediately understandable and actionable for users. Rule updates occur regularly based
on emerging fraud patterns and community feedback to maintain detection accuracy (Lin
et al., 2024).

Machine learning classifiers complement rule-based analysis by identifying subtle
patterns and correlations that might not be apparent through traditional analytical
approaches. The classification system utilizes multiple algorithms including decision
trees for interpretable results, support vector machines for complex pattern recognition,
and ensemble methods that combine multiple approaches for improved accuracy (De
Baets et al., 2024). Training data includes verified examples of fraudulent and legitimate
tokens, with continuous learning capabilities that adapt to new fraud patterns as they
emerge (MDPI, 2025).

The integration architecture ensures that rule engine and classifier results are combined
effectively through weighted scoring algorithms that consider confidence levels,
historical accuracy, and result consistency. Conflicting results between different
analytical approaches trigger additional verification steps and user warnings that
acknowledge uncertainty while providing available information. The system maintains
transparent reporting about the analytical methods used for each assessment, enabling
users to understand and trust the provided intelligence (Hasan et al., 2024).

4.3.4 Local vs Remote Model Execution

The implementation strategy balances computational efficiency, user privacy, and
analytical capability through a hybrid architecture that processes sensitive data locally
while leveraging cloud-based services for computationally intensive analyses. Local
processing handles all user-specific data including wallet addresses, transaction histories,
and portfolio information to ensure complete privacy protection while maintaining fast

component hierarchy implements reactive data binding that ensures automatic interface
updates when underlying data changes (Ressi et al., 2024).

AI analysis components maintain clear separation between different analytical
approaches while enabling coordinated analysis activities. The system includes three
specialized AI classes: WhaleTracker for large transaction detection, ScamDetector for
risk assessment and contract analysis, and SentimentAI for news processing and
sentiment analysis using NLP models. Each AI component implements standardized
interfaces that enable consistent result processing and combination across different
analytical approaches. The AlertSystem class coordinates with all AI components to
generate and manage user notifications. The design supports easy extension with
additional AI capabilities without requiring modifications to existing components (De
Baets et al., 2024).

Data access and external service integration are encapsulated through the APIHandler
class, which manages all API interactions and data formatting operations to isolate the
rest of the system from external service dependencies. This class coordinates external
communications through specialized methods for fetching transactions, prices, and news
data from services like Etherscan and CoinGecko. This abstraction layer enables easy
service provider changes and comprehensive error handling while maintaining consistent
data formats throughout the application (Etherscan, 2024).

The relationships between classes follow a clear hierarchical structure where the
Dashboard uses BlockchainService for data operations, BlockchainService coordinates
with multiple AI analysis components, SentimentAI uses APIHandler for external data
access, and the AlertSystem receives inputs from all AI components to generate
comprehensive user notifications.
